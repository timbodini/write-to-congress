# Write to Congress!

Americans need to be involved and active in the political process. This is a repository of letters about issues of the day ready-to-go to be sent to your elected representatives, along with instructions on quickly contacting our political leaders.

Using this repository, you can make your voice heard with your senators and congressmen in five minutes max.

## The easy way to get in touch with members of Congress

There is a tool called [democracy.io](https://democracy.io) that automatically sends a message to Congress on your behalf.

Simply head to [their website](https://democracy.io), enter your address, select which representatives (best choice is all!) to send to, and enter your message. You can write your own message, or use one of the pre-written letters included in the `letters` directory! Note that you'll need to choose a rough "category" for your letter: the pre-written letters have a suggested topic, but in general it's safe to use any topic that's relevant to your letter.
