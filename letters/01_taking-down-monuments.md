## Text of letter 

**[Sen. ______, Rep. ______:]**

I am writing to express my deep concern over the recent exuberance with which statues and monuments around the country have been defaced and taken down, often without any process of engaging the general public, and sometimes in coordination with protestors, that is to say a particular political group of which I am not a member.

While I'm not the letigious type, nor am I a constitutional scholar, my sense is that the American dream is equal treatment of all citizens. It seems that, in the name of achieving a more equal society, we are inadvertently violating this core doctrine of total equality. Surely you'll agree that any threat to this most American of principles is a threat to our system of self-government itself; we cannot let such a thing stand, for if we do we may find our exception becomes the rule.

This extends even to Confederate statues. These monuments were erected as a sign of healing and national unity followiwng a bitter Civil War; that we tolerate and even celebrate monuments of actual traitors is a testament to our spirit of tolerance for each other. This is an inspiring thing to imagine. And by taking the statues down, we rob our children of the awe we experienced when first learning that, indeed, the winning side agreed to enshrine the losing side in bronze in the name of water under the bridge. 

Pretty or not, this is our great American story, and I believe it's worth preserving -- only under the most severe of circumstances, and with the open and public engagement that is typical with decisions about public displays of art, should a relic of our history be banished to the corner of a second-rate museum.

Those statues are testament to our tradition of tolerance and valued relics of our history, and I believe for that reason they should remain.

Respectfully,

**[YOUR NAME]**
