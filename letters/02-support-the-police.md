## Text of letter 

**[Sen. ______, Rep. ______:]**

I am writing to voice my support for local police departments all over the great state of **[YOUR STATE HERE]**.

Recent calls to defund the police have been irresponsible and have threatened the safety of our communities. Radical ideas are great insofar as they are tested in stages: first a single neighborhood tries something, then a town, then a state, and finally it gets adopted at the federal level. Marijuana legalization, for example, followed this arc: only after gaining experience with small-scale legalization experiments did states fully allow recreational use of the drug.

Whatever one might think about marijuana, this is undoubtedly the model to follow for radical changes to core social structures, and none moreso than replacing the police.

As the guardians of public safety, the police hold a more important role in society than marijuana ever could, so the stakes are much higher. However, it seems that calls to defund the police are rarely accompanied with a suggested replacement -- and while one might hear platitudes about social workers and community response and restorative justice, none of these suggestions are systems that have been tested at scale to protect public safety. As such, their implementation without any facts to suggest efficacy would endanger citizens.

Worse yet, these demands by protestors and politicians alike have left officers unsure whether they have any support at all, and it's very hard to do a job that involves the risk of death without knowing you have the support of your government. Indeed, officers across the country don't know what the rules are anymore; once a single activist DA in Atlanta charged a police officer with malice murder in a case of clear self-defense without so much as waiting for an investigation to be completed, any delusion that equal protections under the law existed for police were put to rest.

As it stands today, we are protecting our criminals, but not our police. We're putting our children in danger because our leaders are too obtuse to realize that public safety is a complicated issue and there are no simple solutions. Our leadership class is behaving like children, unable to understand a need for rules or authority, totally oblivious to the evil that walks among us every day. 

It is not very often that speech puts people in physical danger, but this is one of those rare instances. I believe in free speech, so I'd never ask you to silence anyone; instead, I ask that you clarify for all your position on the matter of local police, and provide some assurance to our local police officers that they can do their jobs without fear of retribution. 

Respectfully,

**[YOUR NAME]**
